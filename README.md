## ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis - Data Analysis using Excel by Raj Rathod

### Overview
Welcome to the "ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis" project repository! In this project, we analyze the call volume trends of the inbound calling team of ABC, an insurance company, to optimize manpower allocation and enhance customer experience.

### Project Details
- **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate
- **Description**:
  The Customer Experience (CX) team of ABC plays a crucial role in managing inbound calls from existing and prospective customers. This project aims to understand the trends in call volume and derive valuable insights to optimize manpower allocation and improve customer experience.
  
  We have been provided with a dataset spanning 23 days, containing details such as agent names and IDs, queue time, call time, call duration, and call status. By analyzing this data, we address questions related to average call duration, call volume analysis, manpower planning, and night shift manpower planning.

2. **Call Volume Analysis**:
   - Visualize the total number of calls received against time in buckets (e.g., 1-2, 2-3 hours).

3. **Manpower Planning**:
   - Propose a plan for manpower allocation during each time bucket to reduce the abandon rate to 10%.

4. **Night Shift Manpower Planning**:
